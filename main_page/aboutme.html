          <p> Hi there! I'm Christopher Elian. You can call me Chris! I was born in New York, and early on in my life moved to New Jersey. One of my life-long hobbies and happinesses in life is competing in a variety of ways, whether it be video games, sports, or academic activities. When I had first entered college, I was looking to pursue a career path in politics. The modern political climate had continued to dissuade me until I finally decided it wasn't the right path for me. Since then, I've been pursuing Software Engineering as a career, which I feel fits very well with my hobbies outside of career related activites! I have always enjoyed pursuing skills and improving upon them, so I think this career will take me far. Regardless of how far, I'm excited to see where it takes me!
